API Content Terms of Use

The Content eXchange Platform (CXP) provides users with access to certain content, including audio, video, text, images and other content from the BBG, DOS and DOD websites, applications and services, and other Content Provider web sites, applications and services (the "CXP Services") through an application programming interface (API). Content accessed through the API ("API Content") is available to registered users only for personal, non-commercial use, or for use by other United States Government agencies.

If you have registered with the CXP, you may use the API Content for personal, non-commercial use, provided that (a) your use is for non-promotional, internet-based purposes only, (b) all links to API Content redirect the user to the CXP Services provider when the user clicks on them. All audio and video must be delivered from the originating server(s) of the CXP Service provider, (c) the date of all API Content is displayed with that content; (d) your use or display of API Content must not suggest that the CXP Services promote or endorse you or any third party or the causes, ideas, web sites, products or services of you or any third party; (e) you shall not modify any API content, headlines, links or metadata included in the API Content; (f) you shall not use the API Content in any way that changes or distorts the fundamental meaning of the content; (g) you may not archive, store or cache, or enable the archiving, storage, caching or downloading of, any API Content; (h) you may use only a limited amount of content from the API; you may not re-create the CXP Services, or any portion thereof; (i) you may not insert any intermediate page, splash page or other content between the links and the applicable API Content source's web page; (j) you must provide attribution for the content to the source CXP Service Provider, by including "CXP" or the name of the relevant API Content source in text in connection with the API Content, but not in the title of any publicly-available application, and provide a link back to the API Content source's web site; and (k) if you use API content in an application pursuant to these terms, and if you make that application available to the public, such as through an app store or app market, (i) you must not use "CXP," "Content eXchange Platform," any CXP Service Provider name, or any CXP Service Provider logo or provided images in the title or name of, or logo or icon for, the application, (ii) the description of the application provided in the app store or app market may include a reference to "CXP," "CXP Services," or any agency, office or program name in a factual description of the content included in the app, provided that the description also notes that the application is not an official CXP Service Provider application. Any other use of a CXP Service Provider's trademarks or service marks, the names or service marks of any API Content source, or of the API Content requires the prior written permission of the CXP Service Provider to who it belongs.

The CXP Service Providers may withdraw API Content from the API at any time. Upon the request of CXP Service Providers, you shall promptly cease all use of, and remove from your web site(s) or other platforms, any API Content identified by the CXP Service Provider(s). CXP Service Providers reserve the right to track usage of the API Content.
