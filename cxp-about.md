#About the CXP

The CXP Application Programming Interface (API) follows, RESTful, Hypermedia API standards to facilitate the distribution of digital content (audio, video, images and text) from multiple USG Foreign Affairs agencies to audiences worldwide.

The CXP is a joint project of the U.S. Government's Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), Department of State (DOS) and Department of Defense (DOD). Its goal is to increase coordination and collaboration across USG Foreign Affairs agencies by organizing, providing greater visibility into and simplifying access to an open repository of unclassified, publicly available multimedia content. 

This improved coordination and collaboration will reduce duplication of efforts among agencies as well as the amount of time, resources and funds required to achieve their missions. At the same time, the CXP API will help widen content distribution and increase USG reach and impact in foreign markets worldwide. 

Users who register with the CXP through our [sign up form](http://oddi.bbg.gov/cxp/#/signup) will be provided an API key from [data.gov](https://data.gov). The BBG does not collect personal information when you visit this website or use the cxp.bbg.gov API unless you choose to provide that information. Please refer to our [privacy policy](http://oddi.bbg.gov/cxp/#/privacy-policy) and the privacy policy found at [https://www.data.gov/privacy-policy](https://www.data.gov/privacy-policy) for more detailed information. 

If you have previously registered for an API key through data.gov, you may use that key to access the CXP API. New users of the CXP will initially be granted limited access to content from the CXP. To be granted access to all avaialble content from the CXP, please contact us to have your API key permissions upgraded.

Please read the documentation, query the API Explorer and visit our [demo](http://oddi.bbg.gov/cxp/demo/#/) to learn more about working with the CXP API.
